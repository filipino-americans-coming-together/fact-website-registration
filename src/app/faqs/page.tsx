        question: "What is FACT?",
        answer: "FACT stands for Filipinx Americans Coming Together and is a conference hosted annually by the Philippine Student Association at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is the largest Filipinx-interest conference in the Midwest, bringing in over 1,000 delegates yearly. The conference works to empower young, rising professionals while simultaneously educating the delegates about Filipinx culture, identity and issues. Despite the conference’s title, the conference is not limited to delegates of Filipinx descent. The facilitators and delegates come from different backgrounds and ethnicities, and the workshops cover a wide array of topics. FACT’s mission is to build a community of leaders by uniting, enlightening and empowering the Filipinx/Fil-Am/Non-Filipinx youth nationwide. By exploring our interests, culture and identity as a rising generation, we hope that our delegates can take with them knowledge that they can apply beyond their college career as leaders in the professional world ready to give back to their community.",
